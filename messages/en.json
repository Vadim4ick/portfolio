    "description": "I have been working in web development for over 4 years. During this time, I created more than 100+ different websites of varying complexity. And I managed to work for a whole year in a commercial company, in team development. At the moment I live in the beautiful, sunny city of Batumi (Georgia), in my free time I like to spend time with family and friends, as well as go hiking in the mountains to “reboot”. Also, in addition to experience in frontend development, I have teaching experience, I trained and prepared junior developers for their first orders."
